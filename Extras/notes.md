### üìö **Theory:**

Computer networks rely on a variety of **cables** and **devices** to transmit data efficiently. The choice of cable or device depends on the type of network (PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN), desired speed, distance, and cost.

#### ‚û§ **Types of Network Cables:**

1. **Twisted Pair Cables (Cat5 / Cat5e / Cat6):**

   * Most widely used in LANs.
   * Composed of twisted copper wires with RJ-45 connectors.
   * Cat6 offers higher bandwidth and less interference than Cat5e.
   * **Used in:** LAN (Ethernet), routers, switches, computers.

2. **Coaxial Cable:**

   * Single copper conductor surrounded by insulation and shielding.
   * **Used in:** Cable internet, CCTV, older LANs.
   * Connector type: BNC or F-type.

3. **Fiber Optic Cable:**

   * Uses glass or plastic strands to transmit data as light.
   * Immune to EMI (Electromagnetic Interference).
   * **Used in:** MANs, WANs, backbone networks.
   * Very high speed and long-distance capability.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Procedure:**

#### üîπ **Part A: Study and Identify Network Cables**

1. Observe the physical characteristics of Cat5e, Cat6, Coaxial, and Fiber Optic cables.
2. Identify the connectors (e.g., RJ-45 for Cat5e/Cat6).
3. Use a **cable tester** to verify connectivity (optional).
4. Note:

   * Length
   * Markings
   * Connector type
   * Cable category

#### üîπ **Part B: Study and Identify Network Devices**

1. Physically examine each device (router, switch, hub, etc.).
2. Identify the number and type of ports (e.g., LAN/WAN).
3. Note down:

   * Power source
   * Number of connections supported
   * Any indicator LEDs

#### üîπ **Part C: Basic LAN Setup (Optional)**

1. Use Ethernet cables to connect two or more computers via a switch.
2. Connect the switch to a router.
3. Observe link lights on devices to confirm connectivity.
4. Use `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS) to check IP assignment.
